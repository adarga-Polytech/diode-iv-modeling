The code behind [borismo.github.io/diode-iv-modeling](https://borismo.github.io/diode-iv-modeling).

This web-based tool helps students and researchers to visualize the impact of diode parameters on an Current-Voltage (IV) characteristic.
It is also possible to import your own data and fit it with the model in order to determine your device's parameters.
